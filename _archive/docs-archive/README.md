# Archive (Curated Legacy Docs)

This folder preserves historically valuable documentation while keeping `main` branch minimal for S0 production use.

## Curation Policy

**Keep**: 
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Data contracts and API specifications  
- Diagrams that explain current V2 lenses
- Migration rationales and implementation notes
- Roadmaps and planning documents

**Drop or leave on migration branch**:
- Environment-specific setup notes
- Superseded how-to guides  
- Speculative drafts and incomplete designs
- Development-only tooling documentation

## Archive Header Convention

Each archived document includes a header line:
```
_Archived from alpha/s0-migration on YYYY-MM-DD; retained for historical context._
```

## Migration Reference

Complete development history and all original documentation remains available on the `alpha/s0-migration` branch, tagged as `migration-s0-freeze`.

## Index

See `MANIFEST.md` for the complete list of archived documents.
