**MNX (MneumonicNexus)** is an event-sourced system with multi-lens projections for relational, semantic, and graph data. This repository contains the Alpha S0 baseline implementation.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mneumonicnexus.git
cd mneumonicnexus

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start services
make up

# Run baseline and tests
make baseline
make test
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

MNX provides a deterministic event-sourced architecture with:

- **Event Gateway**: Idempotent event ingestion with correlation ID propagation
- **Multi-Lens Projections**: Relational, semantic (vector), and graph (AGE) projections
- **Deterministic Replay**: Golden test fixtures ensure reproducible state
- **Multi-Tenancy**: World-based isolation with branch support

### Core Components

- **Gateway Service**: Event ingestion and validation
- **Publisher Service**: CDC-based event distribution
- **Relational Projector**: SQL tables and materialized views
- **Semantic Projector**: Vector embeddings with HNSW indexing
- **Graph Projector**: AGE graph database with branch isolation

## üß™ Testing & Validation

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit
make test-integration

# Run golden replay tests
make golden

# Check service health
make health
```

## üîß Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 16+ (with AGE extension)

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development environment
make up

# Run code quality checks
make lint
make type-check
make format

# Run tests
make test

# Clean up
make down
make clean
```

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for fast Python linting
- **Formatting**: [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for consistent code style
- **Type Checking**: [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type analysis
- **Testing**: [Pytest](https://pytest.org/) with deterministic replay validation

## üìä Monitoring

- **Health Endpoints**: `/health` on all services
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics on `/metrics` endpoints
- **Observability**: Correlation ID tracing across services

## üö® Production Readiness

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status**: Alpha S0 baseline with identified testing gaps

See [Testing Gaps Analysis](docs/TESTING_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed assessment of production readiness blockers.
